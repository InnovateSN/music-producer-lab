# Pricing & Packaging (Institutional Draft)

**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Commercial Model
Pricing should be tied to transparent measurable units:
- active student seats,
- number of schools/campuses,
- support/SLA tier.

## 2. Example Packaging
- **Starter Institution:** up to X active seats, standard SLA.
- **Growth Institution:** up to Y active seats, priority support.
- **Enterprise Institution:** custom seats, custom SLA, dedicated success plan.

## 3. What Must Be in Every Quote
- Seat assumptions and overage policy.
- SLA tier and incident response commitments.
- Contract term and renewal terms.
- Data residency / compliance commitments.
- Onboarding and migration scope.

## 4. Procurement Readiness Rule
No high-value quote should be issued without:
1. signed commercial license terms,
2. DPA alignment,
3. SLA attachment,
4. security/IR summary,
5. validated deployment checklist.
