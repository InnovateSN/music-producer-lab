## Category Overview

**Category:** Harmony & Melody

**Description:** This module teaches you to build chord progressions and write melodies by placing notes and hearing results instantly—no theory dumps. You'll start with simple triads in C major, then level up into seventh chords, inversions, voice leading, genre loops (house/pop/hip-hop/cinematic), and finally advanced color (9ths/11ths/borrowed chords) with pro-level melodic phrasing.

**Total Lessons:** 20

## Complete Lesson List

### BEGINNER LESSONS (1-7, Levels 1-3)

---

### Lesson 1: Build Your First Chord: Major Triad

**Metadata**
- Lesson Number: 1
- Title: Build Your First Chord: Major Triad
- Slug: lesson-harmony-1
- Description: Build a C major chord and hear "stable / happy" harmony instantly.
- Duration: 8–10 min
- Level: Beginner
- Depth Level: 1
- Badge: Free

**Learning Objectives**
- Primary: Build a major triad (root–third–fifth)
- Secondary: Hear "stable home" vs "random notes"
- Transferable: Any DAW = stack three notes at the same time in a MIDI clip

**Exercise Description**
- Put these notes on beat 1 (step 1): C4 + E4 + G4 (same start time)
- Hold for 1 bar (or 4 beats) if your sequencer supports note length
- Listening checkpoint: Does it sound "complete," like it could end a song?

**Theory (Just-in-Time)**
- "Triad" = three-note chord built by stacking every other note in the scale
- Root = chord name (C). Third = emotion hint (major sounds brighter). Fifth = solidity

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 90 BPM
- Key: C Major
- Scale: Major
- Step count: 16 steps (1 bar of 16th steps)
- Required notes/chords: C–E–G together on step 1

**Progression Path**
- Builds nothing (start point)
- Prepares you to change one note to get minor (Lesson 2)

---

### Lesson 2: Flip the Emotion: Major vs Minor

**Metadata**
- Lesson Number: 2
- Title: Flip the Emotion: Major vs Minor
- Slug: lesson-harmony-2
- Description: Change one note to turn C major into C minor.
- Duration: 8–10 min
- Level: Beginner
- Depth Level: 1
- Badge: Free

**Learning Objectives**
- Primary: Convert a major triad to a minor triad
- Secondary: Recognize the "third" as the emotion switch
- Transferable: One-note changes are a core production trick (remixes, sad/bright versions)

**Exercise Description**
- Bar 1: C4–E4–G4 on beat 1
- Bar 2: C4–Eb4–G4 on beat 1 (only E→Eb changes)
- Listening checkpoint: Which one feels darker?

**Theory (JIT)**
- Major third (C→E) vs minor third (C→Eb). Same root, different mood.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 90 BPM
- Key: C
- Scale: Chromatic allowed (so Eb is possible), but highlight C minor notes
- Step count: 32 steps (2 bars)
- Required: Bar 1 = C–E–G, Bar 2 = C–Eb–G

**Progression Path**
- Builds on Lesson 1
- Prepares tension/resolution with two chords (Lesson 3)

- Badge: Free

**Learning Objectives**
- Primary: Build C (I) → G (V)
- Secondary: Hear "dominant pull" back to I
- Transferable: Basic cadence works in pop, house, hip-hop, cinematic

**Exercise Description**
- Bar 1 beat 1: C4–E4–G4
- Bar 2 beat 1: G3–B3–D4 (or G4–B4–D5 if you stay higher)
- Listening checkpoint: Does G feel like it "wants to go somewhere"?

**Theory (JIT)**
- I = home base. V = tension that wants to resolve back to I.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 90 BPM
- Key: C Major
- Scale: Major
- Step count: 32 (2 bars)
- Required: Bar1=C major triad, Bar2=G major triad

**Progression Path**
- Now you can make real progressions (Lesson 4 = I–IV–V)

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 95 BPM
- Key: C Major
- Step count: 64
- Required chords: C, G, Am, F

**Progression Path**
- Next you'll place a melody using chord tones (Lesson 6)

- Lesson Number: 6
- Title: Melody from Chord Tones
- Slug: lesson-harmony-6
- Description: Write a simple melody that "fits" by targeting chord tones.
- Duration: 12–16 min
- Level: Beginner
- Depth Level: 3
- Badge: Free

**Learning Objectives**
- Primary: Build a melody using 1–3–5 of each chord
- Secondary: Avoid "wrong notes" by aiming at stable tones on strong beats
- Transferable: This is how you write toplines over any progression

**Exercise Description**
- Keep Lesson 5 chords (C–G–Am–F)
- Add 8th-notes melody (2 notes per beat) using only chord tones per bar:
  - Over C: C/E/G
  - Over G: G/B/D
  - Over Am: A/C/E
  - Over F: F/A/C
- Listening checkpoint: Do any notes sound "crashy"? If yes, move them to a chord tone.

**Theory (JIT)**
- "Chord tone" = a note inside the chord. Safe anchor points for melody.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 100 BPM
- Key: C Major
- Step count: 64
- Required: progression + at least 8 melody notes restricted to chord tones

**Progression Path**
- Prepares stepwise motion and scale degrees (Lesson 7)

---

### Lesson 7: Stepwise Melody: Use the Scale

- Lesson Number: 7
- Title: Stepwise Melody: Use the Scale
- Slug: lesson-harmony-7
- Description: Expand beyond chord tones using the C major scale safely.
- Duration: 12–18 min
- Level: Beginner
- Depth Level: 3
- Badge: Premium

**Learning Objectives**
- Primary: Use scale notes as "passing tones" between chord tones
- Secondary: Understand strong beats vs in-between beats
- Transferable: "Good melodies" = targets + travel notes

**Exercise Description**
- Keep the same chord loop
- Rule: On beats 1 and 3, use chord tones. On off-beats, you may use any C major scale note (C D E F G A B)
- Listening checkpoint: Do strong beats feel stable even if off-beats move?

**Theory (JIT)**
- Scale degree = position in the scale (1=home). Passing tone = travel note between anchors.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 110 BPM
- Key: C Major
- Step count: 64
- Required: melody includes at least 4 passing tones that resolve to chord tones

**Progression Path**
- Beginner phase complete. Next: seventh chords and richer harmony.

- Transferable: 7ths are standard in house, R&B, lo-fi, pop pads

**Exercise Description**
- Bar 1: Cmaj7 (C–E–G–B)
- Bar 2: Am7 (A–C–E–G)
- Listening checkpoint: Does it feel "wider" and more emotional than triads?

**Theory (JIT)**
- The 7th is the note that creates "air" and sophistication without changing the chord root.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 95 BPM
- Key: C Major
- Step count: 32
- Required chords: Cmaj7, Am7

**Progression Path**
- Prepares full 7th progressions and dominant 7 (Lesson 9)

---

### Lesson 9: Create Pull: Dominant 7

- Transferable: Dominant 7 is a universal resolution tool

**Exercise Description**
- Bar 1: G7 (G–B–D–F)
- Bar 2: C (C–E–G) or Cmaj7
- Listening checkpoint: Does G7 feel unstable, then settle on C?

**Theory (JIT)**
- Dominant 7 adds a note that clashes slightly (color tension), which makes resolution satisfying.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 95 BPM
- Key: C Major
- Step count: 32
- Required: G7 → C (or Cmaj7)

**Progression Path**
- Next: genre loop with 7ths + harmonic rhythm (Lesson 10)

---

### Lesson 10: House Loop: Minor to Major Movement

**Metadata**
- Lesson Number: 10
- Title: House Loop: Minor to Major Movement
- Slug: lesson-harmony-10
- Description: Build a 7th-chord loop used in house and add a simple topline.
- Duration: 15–20 min
- Level: Intermediate
- Depth Level: 5
- Badge: Premium

**Learning Objectives**

**Exercise Description**
- Program 4 bars:
  - Bar 1: Am7 (A–C–E–G)
  - Bar 2: Fmaj7 (F–A–C–E)
  - Bar 3: Cmaj7 (C–E–G–B)
  - Bar 4: G7 (G–B–D–F)
- Add a 1-bar repeating melody using chord tones: try E–G–A–G over Am7 (8th notes), then adapt per chord
- Listening checkpoint: Loop it—does it feel "club-ready" as a chord bed?

**Theory (JIT)**
- Harmonic rhythm = how often chords change. House often stays steady and predictable.
- 7ths make chords smoother for sustained pads.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 124 BPM
- Key: C Major
- Scale: Major
- Step count: 64 (4 bars)
- Required: the 4 chords + at least 4 melody notes that match chord tones

**Progression Path**
- Prepares inversions + voice leading so the loop sounds pro (Lesson 11)

---

### Lesson 11: Smooth the Jumps: Chord Inversions

**Metadata**
- Lesson Number: 11
- Title: Smooth the Jumps: Chord Inversions
- Slug: lesson-harmony-11
- Description: Re-voice chords so notes move by small steps instead of big leaps.
- Duration: 15–18 min
- Level: Intermediate
- Depth Level: 5
- Badge: Premium

**Learning Objectives**
- Primary: Use inversions to minimize note movement between chords
- Secondary: Hear "smooth" vs "blocky" chord changes
- Transferable: This is instant "professional" polish for MIDI chords

**Exercise Description**
- Use Lesson 10 progression
- Re-voice each chord so at least two notes stay the same or move by 1–2 semitones
- Example target motion idea (not the only solution): keep common tones when possible (A/C/E appear often)
- Listening checkpoint: Does the progression feel like it "glides"?

**Theory (JIT)**
- Inversion = same chord notes, different order. Voice leading = how each note moves to the next chord.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 124 BPM
- Key: C Major
- Step count: 64
- Required: progression with inversions; validation can check "max interval jump" per voice

**Progression Path**

**Exercise Description**
- Choose a motif (example): G–A–G–E (8th notes)
- Repeat it each bar, but change the final note to land on a chord tone of that bar
- Listening checkpoint: Does it feel "one melody," not random notes?

**Theory (JIT)**
- Motif = small musical sentence. Variation = keep identity, change detail.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 120 BPM
- Key: C Major
- Step count: 64
- Required: motif repeated at least 3 times with at least 1 controlled variation

**Progression Path**
- Next: hip-hop minor loops + tension notes (Lesson 13)

- Title: Hip-Hop Minor Loop: Dark but Catchy
- Slug: lesson-harmony-13
- Description: Build a minor progression and write a sparse, emotional melody.
- Duration: 14–18 min
- Level: Intermediate
- Depth Level: 6
- Badge: Premium

**Learning Objectives**
- Primary: Build Am7 → Em7 → Fmaj7 → Em7 (or Am → G → F → E for a more classic pull)
- Secondary: Use "few notes" melody (space = vibe)
- Transferable: Minor loops + sparse lead = modern hip-hop/R&B DNA

**Exercise Description**
- Program 4 bars with 7th chords (or triads if your engine is simpler)
- Melody rule: max 3–5 notes per bar, focus on long notes and timing
- Listening checkpoint: Does the silence make it feel heavier?

**Theory (JIT)**

### Lesson 14: Borrow One Chord: Instant Emotion Shift

**Metadata**
- Lesson Number: 14
- Title: Borrow One Chord: Instant Emotion Shift
- Slug: lesson-harmony-14
- Description: Add one "outside" chord to create a dramatic color change.
- Duration: 15–18 min
- Level: Intermediate
- Depth Level: 6
- Badge: Premium

**Learning Objectives**
- Primary: Use a borrowed chord like F minor in C major context
- Secondary: Hear how one chord can change the whole mood
- Transferable: Borrowed chords are everywhere in pop, cinematic, electronic

**Exercise Description**
- Start with C → Am → F → G (safe)
- Replace F with F minor (F–Ab–C) for one bar, then go to G → C
- Listening checkpoint: Do you feel a sudden "wistful / dramatic" twist?

**Theory (JIT)**
- Borrowed chord = you "borrow" from the parallel minor/major to get a new color.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 100 BPM
- Key: C Major (allow chromatic Ab)
- Step count: 64
- Required: progression includes at least one borrowed chord (e.g., Fm) and resolves back

**Progression Path**

### Lesson 15: Add9 Color: Make Chords Glow

**Metadata**
- Lesson Number: 15
- Title: Add9 Color: Make Chords Glow
- Slug: lesson-harmony-15
- Description: Turn plain chords into modern, airy harmonies with add9.

- Level: Advanced
- Depth Level: 7
- Badge: Premium

**Learning Objectives**
- Primary: Build Cadd9 (C–E–G–D) and Fadd9 (F–A–C–G)
- Secondary: Use "color tones" without losing stability
- Transferable: Add9 is common in indie pop, cinematic pads, future bass, ambient

**Exercise Description**
- Make a 4-bar progression: Cadd9 → G → Am7 → Fadd9
- Melody: emphasize the 9th sometimes (D over C, G over F)
- Listening checkpoint: Does it feel "wide" but not dissonant?

**Theory (JIT)**
- 9th = the scale degree above the octave. It adds shimmer without changing the chord's identity.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 110 BPM
- Key: C Major
- Step count: 64
- Required: at least two add9 chords used correctly

**Progression Path**
- Prepares sus chords + dominant resolution (Lesson 16)

- Slug: lesson-harmony-16
- Description: Build a lush progression with sus chords and smooth voice leading.
- Duration: 16–20 min
- Level: Advanced
- Depth Level: 8
- Badge: Premium

**Learning Objectives**
- Primary: Build Cmaj9 → Am11 → Dm9 → G7sus4 → G7 → Cmaj9
- Secondary: Voice-lead by keeping common tones and moving minimally
- Transferable: This is the DNA of R&B/neo-soul keys and jazzy pop

**Exercise Description**
- Program chords across 6 bars (or 8 bars if you want two bars per chord)
- Make the sus: G7sus4 = G–C–D–F (replace B with C), then resolve to G7 = G–B–D–F
- Melody: syncopate (place notes on off-beats), target 9ths/11ths occasionally
- Listening checkpoint: Does the sus→resolve feel like a "release"?

**Theory (JIT)**
- Sus chord delays the "third," creating suspense. Resolution brings the third back.
- Extensions (9/11) add color; voice leading makes it sound intentional.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 92 BPM
- Key: C Major (chromatic allowed if needed)
- Step count: 96 or 128 (6–8 bars)
- Required: include G7sus4 then G7 resolution + at least one extended chord

**Progression Path**
- Next: modal harmony for a new "world" (Lesson 17)

- Duration: 15–18 min
- Level: Advanced
- Depth Level: 8
- Badge: Premium

**Learning Objectives**
- Primary: Build a D Dorian loop (minor feel with a bright 6)
- Secondary: Write melody that highlights the "Dorian note"
- Transferable: Modes are a fast way to escape basic major/minor clichés

**Exercise Description**
- Set key center to D Dorian (notes: D E F G A B C)
- Build 2-chord vamp: Dm7 → G7 (or Dm9 → G13 if available)
- Melody: feature B (the natural 6 in Dorian) as the signature color
- Listening checkpoint: Does it feel minor but "uplifted"?

**Theory (JIT)**
- Dorian = minor scale with a raised 6. That one note changes the vibe.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 122 BPM (funky/house-friendly)
- Key: D
- Scale: Dorian
- Step count: 64
- Required: chord vamp + melody includes the Dorian 6 at least twice

- Secondary: Write a melody that slowly evolves (long notes, arcs)
- Transferable: Works in scoring, ambient, trance breakdowns, intros/outros

**Exercise Description**
- Choose pedal note: C (held in bass for 4–8 bars)
- Above it, move chords: Cmaj7 → Abmaj7 → Fm(add9) → G7 → Cmaj9 (allow chromatic)
- Melody: long notes, stepwise motion, end phrases on chord tones
- Listening checkpoint: Does the constant pedal make the chord shifts feel bigger?

**Theory (JIT)**
- Pedal tone = one note stays while harmony changes, creating tension without busy motion.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 80–90 BPM
- Key: C (chromatic allowed)
- Step count: 128 (8 bars)
- Required: pedal note sustained + at least 4 chord changes above it

- Slug: lesson-harmony-19
- Description: Take one melody and support it with three different chord progressions.
- Duration: 18–20 min
- Level: Expert
- Depth Level: 9
- Badge: Premium

**Learning Objectives**
- Primary: Create 3 chord options under one fixed melody
- Secondary: Maintain melody integrity while changing emotional meaning
- Transferable: This is what pros do for remixes, bridges, and songwriting upgrades

**Exercise Description**
- Create an 8-note melody in C major (simple: mostly stepwise)
- Progression A: diatonic (safe) e.g., C–Am–F–G
- Progression B: borrowed chord twist e.g., C–E7–Am–Fm–G
- Progression C: extended/jazzy e.g., Cmaj9–Am11–Dm9–G13
- Listening checkpoint: Same melody—does the "story" change?

**Theory (JIT)**

### Lesson 20: Pro Voicing Pack: Spread, Stack, and Control

**Metadata**
- Lesson Number: 20
- Title: Pro Voicing Pack: Spread, Stack, and Control
- Slug: lesson-harmony-20
- Description: Build professional chord voicings (spread + top-note control) and a counter-melody.
- Duration: 18–20 min
- Level: Expert
- Depth Level: 10
- Badge: Premium

**Learning Objectives**
- Primary: Voice chords with controlled top note (guide tone)
- Secondary: Write a counter-melody that complements the main melody
- Transferable: This is how you get "record-ready" harmony movement

**Exercise Description**
- Choose a 4-chord loop (your favorite from Lessons 10–16)
- Make voicings with:
  - Bass note low (root or 5th)
  - Mid voices close (3rd/7th/9th)
  - Top note forms a mini-melody across chords (e.g., G → A → B → C)
- Add counter-melody: short, sparse, answering the main melody
- Listening checkpoint: Does the top line feel like its own hook even without drums?

**Theory (JIT)**
- Top-note control = what listeners often perceive as the "melody inside the chords."
- Counter-melody = supportive second voice that avoids fighting the lead.

**Sequencer Configuration**
- Tempo: 110–125 BPM (genre choice)
- Key: user choice (suggest G major or A minor for variety)
- Step count: 64–128
- Required: at least 4-note voicings + a distinct top-note line + counter-melody phrase

**Progression Path**
- Capstone: combines harmony, voice leading, melody writing, and arrangement thinking

## Suggested Sequencer Features (UI/UX for teaching harmony)

### 1. Chord Builder + Chord Name Detection
- When students stack notes, display detected chord name (e.g., "Cmaj7") with a confidence meter
- If "almost correct," show a hint: "Try adding B for maj7."

### 2. Scale Highlighting + "Safe Notes" Mode
- Highlight scale notes in the piano roll; optionally hide non-scale notes for beginner steps
- Allow "Chromatic allowed" toggle for borrowed chords lessons

### 3. Chord-Tone Highlighting for Melody Notes
- When melody plays, color/mark whether each note is: chord tone / passing tone / tension tone
- Great for instant feedback without long explanations

### 4. Voice-Leading Visual Lines
- Draw subtle lines from each chord note to its next-note target to show movement
- Add a "smoothness score" based on average motion (helpful in inversion lessons)

### 5. Harmonic Rhythm Grid
- Show chord blocks across bars (like arrangement lanes): "Chord changes every 1 bar / 2 bars."
- Makes house/pop timing concepts visual

### 6. Listening Checkpoints as Buttons
- "Solo chords," "Solo melody," "Metronome off," "Loop 2 bars," "Loop 4 bars."
- A/B switch between "before inversion" and "after inversion."

### 7. Goal Validation System
- Validate exact note sets at specific times (beginner)
- Later validate relationships (contains 3rd+7th, top note line moves stepwise, max leap limit, etc.)

### 8. DAW Transfer Prompt Panel
- One small panel per lesson: "In Ableton: create MIDI clip → draw these notes → loop 4 bars → try a pad sound."

## Implementation Notes

### Next Steps for Integration

1. **Create Config Files**: Convert each lesson into a JavaScript config file following the drum lesson pattern
2. **Sequencer Enhancements**: Implement chord detection, scale highlighting, voice-leading visualization
3. **Audio Engine**: Add polyphonic note playback (chords) if not already supported
4. **Validation Logic**: Build chord validation (note sets, inversions, voice leading rules)
5. **UI Components**: Create chord builder interface, melody/chord separation, theory popups
6. **Sample Sounds**: Curate piano, pad, synth sounds suitable for harmony lessons
7. **Curriculum Integration**: Add Harmony & Melody category to `curriculum.js` alongside Drums & Rhythm

### Technical Considerations

- **Polyphony**: Sequencer must support multiple simultaneous notes
- **MIDI Note Representation**: Use standard MIDI note numbers (C4 = 60)
- **Chord Detection Algorithm**: Implement real-time chord name recognition
- **Voice Leading Validation**: Calculate interval jumps between chord changes
- **Scale Filters**: Allow toggling between diatonic/chromatic note availability
- **Audio Samples**: High-quality multi-sampled instruments for realistic playback
