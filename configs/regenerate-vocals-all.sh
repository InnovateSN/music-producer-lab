        content: \`$title is crucial for achieving professional vocal productions that compete with commercial releases.

**Core Concepts:**
- Vocal recording and production fundamentals
- Technical requirements and equipment considerations
- Signal flow and processing chain order
- Common issues and how to solve them
- Genre-specific approaches and standards

**Professional Workflow:**
1. **Preparation** — Set up properly before recording
2. **Capture** — Record high-quality source material
3. **Edit** — Clean up and comp the best takes
4. **Process** — Apply corrective and creative processing
5. **Mix** — Blend vocals perfectly with the track
6. **Finalize** — Ensure vocals translate across systems

**Critical Factors:**
- **Source quality** — Good recording = easier mixing
- **Performance** — Technical skill matters more than processing
- **Context** — Vocals must serve the song
- **Reference** — Always compare to professional standards

Professional vocal producers understand that $title is both technical skill and artistic judgment.\`

        title: 'Professional Vocal Production Techniques',
        content: \`Apply $title in your productions with professional approaches:

**Recording Best Practices:**
- Proper mic placement and distance
- Optimal gain staging and headroom
- Multiple takes for comping
- Consistent recording environment
- Reference monitoring and acoustics

**Processing Workflow:**
1. **Clean up** — Remove unwanted sounds and noise
2. **Tune** — Correct pitch issues (subtle or creative)
3. **Time align** — Fix timing and rhythm issues
4. **EQ** — Remove muddiness, add presence
5. **Compress** — Control dynamics and consistency
6. **De-ess** — Tame harsh sibilance
7. **FX** — Add reverb, delay, modulation

**Common Vocal Issues:**
- **Muddiness** — High-pass filter at 80-100 Hz
- **Harshness** — De-ess or cut 6-8 kHz
- **Lack of presence** — Boost 3-5 kHz subtly
- **Inconsistent levels** — Compression and automation
- **Poor timing** — Edit before processing
- **Pitch issues** — Tune before heavy processing

**Genre Considerations:**
Different genres require different vocal approaches:
- **Pop** — Polished, present, tuned, compressed
- **Hip-Hop** — Dry, upfront, minimal reverb
- **R&B** — Smooth, warm, layered harmonies
- **Rock** — Raw energy, less processing
- **Electronic** — Creative effects, vocoders, pitch shifts

Study vocal productions in your genre and understand what makes them work.\`
