        title: 'Understanding Stem Mastering',
        content: `Stem Mastering is the final step in audio production, preparing your mix for distribution and ensuring it translates across all playback systems.

**Core Mastering Concepts:**
- The difference between mixing and mastering
- When and why mastering is necessary
- Proper mastering signal flow and processing order
- Loudness standards and streaming normalization
- Format delivery specifications (WAV, MP3, DDP, etc.)

**Mastering Goals:**
1. **Tonal balance** — Ensure consistent frequency response
2. **Dynamics** — Control dynamic range appropriately
3. **Loudness** — Achieve competitive levels without distortion
4. **Stereo image** — Optimize stereo width and mono compatibility
5. **Consistency** — Create cohesion across an album or EP
6. **Technical compliance** — Meet distribution specifications

**Professional Mastering Workflow:**
The mastering engineer's job is to:
- Make the mix translate across all playback systems
- Achieve competitive loudness for the genre
- Fix minor mix issues (if possible)
- Prepare different versions (streaming, CD, vinyl, etc.)
- Provide the final deliverable files

Understanding Stem Mastering means knowing when to apply it and when to leave things alone.`

        title: 'Professional Mastering Techniques',
        content: `Apply Stem Mastering with professional standards and workflows:

**Pre-Mastering Checklist:**
- Mix is final and approved
- Proper headroom (-6 dB to -3 dB peaks)
- No clipping or distortion
- No processing on master bus
- All automation printed
- Files are high-resolution (24-bit minimum)

**Mastering Signal Chain:**
1. **Analysis** — Measure levels, spectrum, dynamics
2. **Linear phase EQ** — Tonal balance adjustments
3. **Multiband compression** — Control frequency-specific dynamics (if needed)
4. **Mastering compression** — Gentle glue compression
5. **Mid-side processing** — Stereo width optimization
6. **Limiting** — Final loudness maximization
7. **Dithering** — Bit-depth reduction for final format

**Critical Measurements:**
- **Integrated LUFS** — Target: -14 LUFS (streaming), -8 to -6 LUFS (club/radio)
- **True Peak** — Max: -1 dBTP (streaming), -0.3 dBTP (safety)
- **Dynamic Range** — Maintain at least 8-10 DR for musicality
- **Stereo Correlation** — Keep above +0.7, watch for phase issues

**Common Mastering Mistakes:**
- Over-limiting and destroying dynamics
- Too much processing (trying to "fix" the mix)
- Ignoring streaming normalization
- Not checking mono compatibility
- Mastering before mix is finalized
- Not referencing professional masters

**Platform-Specific Considerations:**
- **Spotify** — Normalizes to -14 LUFS, reduces louder tracks
- **Apple Music** — Normalizes to -16 LUFS with Sound Check
- **YouTube** — Normalizes to -13 LUFS
- **CD** — No normalization, target -8 to -6 LUFS
- **Vinyl** — Special considerations for low-end and stereo width

Always deliver masters at -14 LUFS integrated for streaming, and provide alternate masters for other formats if needed.`
