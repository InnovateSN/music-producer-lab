            <h3>Complete Bass Production Workflow</h3>
            <p>Here's the professional workflow for creating bass from scratch to final mix:</p>

            <p><strong>Step 1: Sound Design (Lesson 17)</strong></p>
            <pre>
1. Choose synthesis method:
   - Subtractive (oscillator + filter)
   - FM (frequency modulation)
   - Sample-based (808, live bass)

2. Build three layers:
   - SUB: Sine wave, 40-80 Hz
   - MID: Sawtooth/square, filtered 80-500 Hz
   - TOP: Distorted harmonics, 500-2000 Hz

3. Shape with envelopes:
   - Sub: Instant attack, full sustain
   - Mid: 10-30ms attack, 70% sustain
   - Top: Short, percussive attack

4. Add modulation:
   - LFO to filter for wobble (optional)
   - Filter envelope for movement
   - Pitch envelope for 808 dive (if needed)
</pre>

            <p><strong>Step 2: Programming (Lessons 11-16)</strong></p>
            <pre>
1. Choose genre/style:
   - Funk: Syncopated, ghost notes, groove
   - Jazz: Walking, chord tones, chromatic
   - Blues: Root-fifth, turnarounds
   - R&B: Smooth, minimal, space
   - Reggae: One-drop, heavy sub
   - UK Garage: 2-step, skippy

2. Program MIDI pattern:
   - Start with root notes on strong beats
   - Add melodic movement appropriate to genre
   - Vary velocity (ghost notes, emphasis)
   - Add timing humanization (±5-15ms)

3. Test in context:
   - Play with full arrangement
   - Adjust to fit drums, vocals, keys
</pre>

            <p><strong>Step 3: EQ & Mixing (Lesson 18)</strong></p>
            <pre>
1. High-pass filter at 30-40 Hz:
   - Remove subsonic rumble
   - Prevent speaker damage

2. Remove mud (200-400 Hz):
   - Sweep to find worst buildup
   - Cut -3 to -6 dB (narrow Q)

3. Boost clarity (1.5-2.5 kHz):
   - Add +2 to +4 dB (wide Q)
   - Improves small speaker translation

4. Manage sub-bass relationship:
   - Bass owns sub OR kick owns sub
   - Use sidechain compression if needed
   - Separate by 15-20 Hz if both in sub

5. Mix in context:
   - EQ bass to fit with kick, vocals, keys
   - A/B with professional reference tracks
</pre>

            <p><strong>Step 4: Expression & Automation (Lesson 19)</strong></p>
            <pre>
1. Add pitch expression:
   - Portamento slides (funk, dub)
   - Pitch bends (808 trap slides)
   - Vibrato on sustained notes

2. Automate filter cutoff:
   - Build-ups (closed → open)
   - Drops (open → closed)
   - Wobble (rhythmic LFO)

3. Volume automation:
   - Crescendo before drops
   - Silence before impact
   - Sidechain ducking with kick

4. Effects automation:
   - Reverb throws at phrase ends
   - Delay feedback builds
   - Distortion for intensity
</pre>

            <p><strong>Step 5: Final Polish</strong></p>
            <pre>
1. Compression:
   - Ratio: 3:1 to 6:1
   - Attack: 10-30ms (keep transients)
   - Release: Auto or 100-300ms
   - Goal: Even out dynamics, add sustain

2. Saturation (optional):
   - Adds warmth and upper harmonics
   - Helps small speaker translation
   - Use subtly (10-30% mix)

3. Limiting (if needed):
   - Catch peaks, protect headroom
   - -0.3 dB ceiling (safety)
   - Transparent limiting, no pumping

4. Final check:
   - Listen on multiple systems (phone, car, monitors)
   - Check mono compatibility (phase issues?)
   - A/B with reference tracks
</pre>

            <h3>Multi-Genre Bass Showcase</h3>
            <p>Professional bassists are versatile — they master multiple styles. Here's how to apply your knowledge across genres:</p>

            <p><strong>Hip-Hop Bass:</strong></p>
            <pre>
Sound: 808 sub (sine wave with pitch dive)
Pattern: Root notes, minimal movement, heavy weight
EQ: Full sub (40-60 Hz), cut mids (200-400 Hz)
Processing: Slight distortion for harmonics
Reference: Travis Scott, Metro Boomin, Dr. Dre
</pre>

            <p><strong>Rock Bass:</strong></p>
            <pre>
Sound: Moog-style (triangle/saw, warm filter)
Pattern: Root-fifth, driving, locked with kick
EQ: Cut sub (make space for kick), boost 100-200 Hz
Processing: Compression for punch, no distortion
Reference: Led Zeppelin, Red Hot Chili Peppers
</pre>

            <p><strong>EDM Bass:</strong></p>
            <pre>
Sound: Layered reese + sub, aggressive mid-range
Pattern: Simple (let drops and builds do the work)
EQ: Heavy sidechain, cut 200-400 Hz
Processing: Heavy compression, distortion on drops
Reference: Deadmau5, Flume, ODESZA
</pre>

            <p><strong>Jazz Bass:</strong></p>
            <pre>
Sound: Warm sine/triangle, soft attack

</pre>

            <p><strong>Dubstep Bass:</strong></p>
            <pre>
Sound: FM or detuned saw, wobble LFO
Pattern: Half-time feel, space for wobbles
EQ: Sub at 50 Hz, wobble in mids (200-800 Hz)
Processing: Heavy distortion, extreme automation
Reference: Skrillex, Excision, Virtual Riot
</pre>
          </div>

            <h3>Professional Tips & Best Practices</h3>

            <p><strong>1. Always Layer Sub + Mid + Top:</strong></p>
            <p>Don't rely on a single synth for bass. Layer pure sub (sine), warm mid (filtered saw), and bright top (distorted harmonics) for fullness across all playback systems.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Reference Professional Tracks:</strong></p>
            <p>Load reference tracks in your genre. A/B your bass with theirs. Match frequency balance, loudness, and spatial width.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Less is More (R&B Philosophy):</strong></p>
            <p>Busy bass clutters the mix. Play fewer notes with more intention. Space creates pocket and groove.</p>

            <p><strong>4. EQ in Context, Not Solo:</strong></p>
            <p>Bass that sounds perfect soloed often doesn't fit the mix. Always EQ while listening to the full arrangement.</p>

            <p><strong>5. Sidechain is Your Friend:</strong></p>
            <p>Don't fight the kick for sub-bass space. Use sidechain compression to duck bass when the kick hits. This creates the pumping groove in modern music.</p>

            <p><strong>6. Automate for Impact:</strong></p>
            <p>Static bass is boring. Automate filter sweeps before drops, add pitch glides for expression, and use reverb throws for drama.</p>

            <p><strong>7. Keep Sub Mono, Widen Mids:</strong></p>
            <p>Sub-bass (below 100 Hz) should be MONO (centered). Only stereo-widen mid and high frequencies. This prevents phase cancellation.</p>

            <p><strong>8. Listen on Multiple Systems:</strong></p>
            <p>Check your bass on monitors, headphones, phone speakers, and a car. If it doesn't translate everywhere, adjust EQ and layering.</p>

            <p><strong>9. Master the Genre DNA:</strong></p>
            <p>Funk bass emphasizes off-beats. Jazz walks through chord changes. Reggae hits on 1 & 3. UK Garage is skippy 2-step. Know the rules before you break them.</p>

            <p><strong>10. Trust Your Ears:</strong></p>
            <p>Technical knowledge is a tool, not a rule. If it sounds good, it is good. Use your ears as the final judge.</p>
          </div>
