## Testing Checklist

Before publishing:
- [ ] Watch video with sound off (captions readable?)

- [ ] Check audio levels (voiceover clear, music not overpowering?)
- [ ] Verify all links in description work
- [ ] Proof-read all text overlays (no typos!)
- [ ] Test QR code (if used)
- [ ] Get feedback from 2-3 people
- [ ] Add closed captions (YouTube auto-generate, then edit)

---

## Performance Metrics to Track

Once published, track:
- **Views:** Target 500+ views in first month
- **Avg. watch time:** Aim for 2:00+ (60%+ retention)
- **Drop-off points:** Where do people stop watching?
- **Click-through rate:** How many click CTA link?
- **Conversions:** How many trial signups from video?

**Optimize based on data:**
- If drop-off at 0:30 → Hook not strong enough
- If low CTR → CTA not compelling
- If low conversions → Pricing unclear or too high
