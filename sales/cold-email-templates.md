## Breakup Email (Alternative Follow-Up 2)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

I've tried reaching out a couple of times about **Music Producer Lab**, but haven't heard back.

I'm assuming one of these is true:

❌ Not interested
❌ Bad timing
❌ Emails going to spam
❌ Too busy (totally understand!)

If you're not interested, just reply "NOT INTERESTED" and I'll close your file — no hard feelings.

But if it's just bad timing, reply "MAYBE LATER" and I'll check back in September/January.

Either way, thanks for reading!

Best,
[Your Name]
